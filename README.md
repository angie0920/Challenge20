## Overview
This challenge asks to build a smart contract in solidity using Remix IDE. The smart contract consists of a joint savings account that can receive deposits and make withdrawals using two required set accounts.

## The Results

The instructions ask to assign the contract's variables and finish coding the functions provided in the starter code file. After this, the contract is compiled, deployed, accounts are set, and tested for functionality. Here are screenshots of the aforementioned:
